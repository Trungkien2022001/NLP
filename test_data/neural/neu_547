A brilliant min-PC. Fit it with DDR3 Memory and an SSD  rest it on top of an external CD/DVD drive  and enjoy desktop performance.    The standard Intel NUS comes without Memory or an SSD  or an external CD/DVD  so choose for yourself the best you can.    After loading Windows  restart  press F10  and select load Windows from Hard Disk rather than from CD/DVD.
