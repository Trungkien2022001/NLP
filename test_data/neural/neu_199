I&#039;m using G3 phone. Lately my G3 phone case is broken so I&#039;m going to buy case on Lazada that price so cheap and I orderd. Several day after I received the package. The box is real but phone case is not real. It&#039;s fake. lol. Even if it&#039;s not feat with my phone.  And then I&#039;ll refund just 80% because I broken the box. I can approve that I broken the box. But It&#039;s charge of 20% of all?? About 2 weeks ago here is no reputation of product on this page. Today just I saw the 3 people&#039;s comment  They give the 5 stars. Hey friends Don&#039;t be idiot as like me. Today I did learn Vietnam&#039; saying Tien nao cua day. Thank you for teaching me.
