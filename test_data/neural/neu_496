These watches were given to my neighbors  who are not the wealthy  but neither am I.  I chose this model as it reflects what I believe to be a dragon.  This symbol is associated with Asia culture and art.  Both parties were happy to have this gift and their happiness was great to see this Lunar New Year.  I was impressed with the size and quality at first sight.  This company is a great company and its prices are more than fair.
