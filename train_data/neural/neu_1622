the image quality is acceptable for something this small and the wifi set up for ur phone is easy I find this product extremely disapponting. It gets REALLY hot 1-2 mins after its turned on; to the point you litterally cant touch it. Then after the first 3 hours it totally crashed. No lights. No signal. Theres no service!
